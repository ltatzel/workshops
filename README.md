====================

This is the repository containing the material for the workshop
[**Standards and Good Practices for Software Development in Python**](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/events/standards-and-good-practices-for-software-development-in-python-s4-workshop-0fbbfba1-a4c9-4c41-945e-04d109435fa4)
organized by the [Software Workshop](https://is.mpg.de/en/software-workshop) for the [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/).

It will take place **remotely** on **Thursday, October 28**.

Before the workshop
-------------------

Please make sure you have completed the following steps **before** the workshop:

* you have installed `Python3` on your machine. We recommend a default system python installation over the `Anaconda` distribution;
* you have installed your favorite environment for writing code. We recommend using an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment(**IDE**, e.g. `VS Code`, `PyCharm`, `Eclipse`, `Atom`...) but you can also use `Emacs` or `vim` if you are courageous enough;
* you have installed `git` on your machine;
* you have installed a git client in order to perform git operations.
The most popular solutions are `SourceTree` (macOS/Win) and `GitKraken` (Linux/macOS/Win) but you can also use IDE plugins.
* you have successfully cloned this repository locally on your machine and you can perform some trivial operations (fetch, create a branch...);
* you are relaxed and in a happy mood!
