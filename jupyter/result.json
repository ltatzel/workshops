Basic ergonomic keyboards won't give you a lot, custom ergonomic keyboards will take a lot of you time to get used to and to build/solder/adjust firmware and so on. In addition to that most ergonomic keyboards are not portable.\n\nNon of those improvements will solve problems with neck/back/vessels.\n\nI already invested some time to dvorak layout and a lot of time into custom keyboards.\n\nIn the future it will make sense to buy a laptop with ergonomic keyboard (when they appear). For now I would suggest to make a simple remap, maybe switch to better layout (~4 weeks, but can be beneficial in long term) and for sure learn how to organize your work and how to rest properly to reduce the usage of computer."

Perhaps there are a any better layout, but I don't find yet the \"best layout\".\n\nYou can to obtain easily a prebuilt custom ergonomic keyboard, you don't need a engineering career for to buy one, the same way, you don't need to pay a software engineer for to make simple remap.\n\nAlso, the ergonomic keyboard are so portable as a classic keyboard, even you can obtain a specific bag for them if you want, but it's a irrelevant appreciation.\n\nThe laptop keyboard are the worst keyboard possible sadly, they are the opposite to ergonomy."
